### Problem
```text
Someone made this site for the Autobots to chat with each other. Seems like the Decepticons have found the site too and made accounts.
One of the Autobot accounts has a flag that they're trying to keep hidden from the Decepticons, can you figure out which account it is and steal it?
```
